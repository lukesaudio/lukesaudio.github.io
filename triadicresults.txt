2 is similar to 3

Similarities:
Samples two and three both have slight echoes with a high pitch to them. The echo seems to end dully as if they are both indoors in smaller spaces, rather than a large open room. Potentially in a home as there is a warmth to them?

Differences:
Sample one in contrast sounds bright. It has a more open quality as if it is on a much larger space with nothing for the sound to reflect off - maybe outside or just a large room. This gives a whimsical quality to the sound, it sounds like there is a slight echoey twinkle which fades into each word. It is a somewhat exciting sound,.

Paphorn - Church St Paul (UnityEngine.AudioClip)

1 is similar to 3

Similarities:
The reverb on these sounds is bright, metallic and short. It doesn't dissipate but somewhat abruptly stops. This could be a very confined space, maybe one of them is a padded cell? 

Differences:
Sample two on the other hand has a long ghostly echo maybe in a cave or a dungeon. It's the kind of sound I associate from films as being underground and makes me feel alert as is sometimes associated with danger. It has a sharp quality which makes me think of high ceilings.

2 is similar to 3

Similarities:
In sample 2 and 3 the original sound is pushed backwards compared to the echo. They sound as if they are outdoors and the sound is being whisked away by the natural expanse as there is nothing to reflect off of. 

Differences:
Sample 1 in contrast has a ringing quality to the sound that almost amplifies the original sound by its quick succession. It sounds happy.

sample 2 and 3 have an almost regal reverb quality that makes the original sound seem important. It is full, warm and slow. It reminds me of outdoor theatres or castles.

1 is similar to 2

Similarities:
Sample 1 and 2 have a very clear echo on the original sound. Whilst sample 2 is booming, sample 1 is slightly softer but both are intirguing. They sound like the are reflecting oof of water perhaps a swimmng pool, there is a wave-like quality where there is multiple things to reflect off of. They are both engaging.

Differences:
In sample 3 the reverb is muffled and warm. It is short as if in a small room.

1 is similar to 2

Similarities:
Sample 1 and 2 are warm and defined. I can't work out where they are though sample 2 could be an arena? I think sample 1 is inside but the reverb has the same warm, resonating, friendly tone. 

Differences:
On the other hand sample 2 has a subtle quality. It more amplifies the original sound than distract from it. It is short, quiet and muffled.

1 is similar to 3

Similarities:
These two sound incredibly similar. There is abrightness that sounds as if the walls are very close and in a confined space. The reverb is high pitched and metallic.

Differences:
This sample (2) has  a long, quiet echo. It allows the sound to travel further, like a ringing in the ears.

Light Gunshot - Masterphonics (UnityEngine.AudioClip)

1 is similar to 3

Similarities:
Sample 1 and two have booming qaulties, although sample 1 is more extended than the other I kind of consider them identical qualities otherwise. They are somewhat muffled, or the opposite of distinct? There is a quality that seems errie as the sound is heard over nd over again.

Differences:
Sample 2 is flat, boring, muted. It is a blunt stop to the sound in contrast to the other two. Maybe a pillow?

Differences:
Sample 2 is bright and warm. It has a ringing that is soft and subtle. It gives more character to the original sound.
