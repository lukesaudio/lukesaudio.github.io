# Watercolour Squares
A simple repeating squares generator and GUI that, with a low opacity, kinda looks like watercolour!

![an artistic output created with the p5.js code created here. This art is striped in style, using a plethora of colours to create a rainbow-like effect. The painting looks as if it was watercolour](https://github.com/lukesaudio/Watercolour-Squares/blob/main/outputs/14.png "Output 14")

## Functionality:
* Colour Red value Slider - modifies RGBA red channel
* Colour Green value Slider - modifies RGBA green channel

* Toggle Pause - Pauses/Unpauses the drawing by setting the framerate to 0/60fps
