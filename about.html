                    Greetings, neighbour. Welcome to my website. If you're on this about page, I'll assume you want to know a bit more about who the 'eff I am.
                    My name is Luke (he/him). I'm originally from the West Midlands (big up Woo) and very proud of that fact. I spent most of my childhood pissing about with
                    family computers, PC and Playstation games, and eventually instruments. <br>
                    
                    I did a paper round for a while and saved up my pennies for a sparkly red guitar out of the newspaper (£50 smackeroons it cost).
                    I was definitely born to play drums, but alas, that didn't happen until I found drums in college.
                    
                    Speaking of, I got MAD into audio at this point. Lived in the college studios and recorded so much stuff with friends. Eventually, this took me to uni
                    and I did it as a degree. Twas at this point, I realise... <em>I fucking love games, dude.</em> Henceforth, I do game audio going forward, learning Unity and FMOD 
                    and making stuff to do with reverberation. 

                    ...and then I get to Masters. I do an MSc in Creative Technology and Design, and it's at this stage I first discover accessible design. And it kinda recontexutalises everything
                    I've done. <em>"Wait, I don't have to just lump it or leave it when I'm struggling to accesss something? People can actually make things that work for different types of people?"</em>
                    
                    
                </p>
                
            </div>
        </div>       

        <div id="templateRight">

            <div id="sectionContentLeft">
                <h1 id="sectionTitleLeft">Self-loving futures</h1>
                    <p id="sectionTextLeft">
                        It's also around this stage I start to accept and embrace the ways I am different. I have a brain that is <em>spicy</em> and a hip that doesn't work properly all the time. I still deserve to do stuff, right? 
                        And so I make the silly little decision to do a PhD on accessible gaming with sound. I don't know how to make assistive tech for dodgy hips, 
                        and I'm kinda new to the neurodivergent design space, but I sure as heck know how to make a bangin' bit of wiggly noise. 
                        So I've spent time figuring out where my love of sound and games intersects with accessibility. It's been a wild journey this far, and currently I'm at odds with
                        navigation. <em>How the fuck do we successfully get from A to B with sound and a controller?</em><br><br>

                        I counterbalance these switched-on brain shenanigans by making stuff. I'm now in Bristol, which completely radiates acceptance, creativity and being unapologetically yourself.
                        Sometimes I dress up as a spaceperson, sometimes I rap, sometimes I cook super spicy food and cry about it, 
                        sometimes I make art throughout October for a project called <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:phcsjv2nvcjx3iqplhnvnyyg">NerdfArters</a>

                        Whatever it is, I'm making stuff, and that's what you'll get by checking out other parts of my website.                        
                        So thanks for this parasocial bonding experience. I hope you enjoyed reading this and hope you enjoy the ride.
