      <h1>Who the eff is Luke Child?</h1>
      <p class="mainContentRightText">
      Luke Child is a PhD Student, Lecturer and Creative Technologist. Luke is a White male with a bushy beard,
      quiffed short hair and glasses. He usually dons something colourful and abstract, with fashionable items ranging from
      neon cat <a href="https://lucyandyak.com">Lucy and Yaks </a> to <a href="https://pizzamas.com/">a collection of t-shirts with author John Green's mustaschio-ed face on it.</a><br><br>

      Originally from Worcester, home of the famous mispronounced sauce, he now operates out of Bristol, UK. Luke is working towards a PhD in Accessible Sonic Interaction Design in Virtual Environments and collaborates with undergraduate students working on 
      research methods, audio programming, and accessible design.<br><br>

      A big fan of weird and wonderful things, Luke likes music that ventures into experimental territories (particularly rhythmic), patching together 
      unconventional signal chains, and making and breaking things in the quest for surprising outcomes. He is almost always listening to
      <a href="https://www.biffyclyro.com">Biffy Clyro</a>, or at least music with some weird time-based tomfoolery. He also very much loves Corgis and befriends them at a moments notice. You can also add enjoying Japanese food and whiskey, kicking ass at Scrabble, and having a tense relationship with seagulls, to this list.
