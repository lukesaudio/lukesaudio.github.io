                I am an audio researcher, musician and creative technologist who is a fiercely proud West Midlander at heart, but now resides in Bristol, UK<br><br>
                
                I got into music through listening to Foo Fighters, Biffy Clyro and Trivium endlessly in my younger years, trying to learn guitar parts so that I could jam along<br><br>

                When I became an angsty emo teen, I started writing and recording my own music, before embarking on Creative Music Technology BSc. I transitioned my love of audio into a new found love of research through an MSc in Creative Technology. <br><br>

                I now get stuck in with all things audio perception, audio accessibility and interactive audio, and am actively researching in these areas<br><br>

                Away from this, you'll find me messing around with weird time signatures, playing board games, or assembling plugin chains that would make an mix engineer cry

          <div class="text">Perhaps the cutest photograph of me to exist. This is a photograph I took of a photograph of me as a child. I am around 9 years old (I think) and am a young male with short blonde hair and a big smile. I am sat in front of my parents first home computer, a big chunky white computer with a monitor, and a media section that accepts floppy disks and CD-Roms. My mum is taking the photo of me, but not in frame. The backdrop is a computer desk and keyboard, with a rack of hard-to-see CDs.  </div>
