                    Howdy, Neighbour! I am Luke! (he/him pronouns). You're here because you want to know a bit more about it. That's very sweet.    
                    
                    <br><br>

                    Originally from the West Midlands (big up Woo), I am now a Bristol-based neurodivergent maker of all things music, accessibility and video games. I also walk with a dodgy hip 
                    sometimes! 
                    
                    <br><br>

                    My background is in music performance and production. I've in bands and studios since I was 14, which you can read more about on my music page. I have a 
                    penchant for the alternative, the colourful, and the downright weird. You'll find me everywhere from being head-to-toe dressed in something 
                    bright and beautiful (or goth, it depends), to making awful code that puts googly eyes and huge smiles on fluffy clouds, 
                    or making tunes with enough uncouth decisions to make the entire band weep.

                           In more recent years, I am more of a creative technologist fully embracing their neurospicy, whimsical demeanour. I build cool stuff with tech with a focus on accessibility, 
                        with my current project being completing my PhD (it's a big ol' project). I'm currently studing auditory navigation in video games through building a toolkit that enables 
                        devs to develop accessible auditory navigational game mechanics for Blind and Low Vision gamers. 

                        <br><br>

                        I do be doing the games lots. I tend to enjoy open world RPGs, the odd first person shooter, and a good party game with friends! I'm usually listening to bands 
                        Biffy Clyro, Press to Meco (RIP), Blank Atlas, Trivium, Trust Fund Ozu, or something equally epic and off-kilter. That, or trying to mimic math rock bands on guitar with little success. We can also chat about chess, hot sauce, 
                        whiskey, corgis, trackmania, maths or fighting the good fight. I am overtly chatty, love coffee and will always seek out for a chinwag with strangers, 
                        so please feel free to do the same!
