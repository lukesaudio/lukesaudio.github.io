					<p>Luke is a creative programmer and musician currently based in Bristol, UK. Luke's projects are typically based around video games and audio, and often branch out into other new and exciting digital realms, also. </p>

					<p>
						Formally, Luke is trained in Creative Music Technology at undergraduate level, and Creative Technology at Masters level, however he came to university as a budding musician, and as such has ventured into pathways that feature both sonic and gamified elements at their core. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Though he doesn't like to admit it to clients, since being a kid, Luke has played a lot of video games, and his knowledge base is centred around the iconic and lasting experiences within them. Both his university research projects, 'Exploring Adaptive Reverberation in Video Games' and 'Developing a Framework for Understanding the Perception of Reverberation in Video Games' stemmed from key moments that he remembers from gaming as a teenager, and it's this attention to wonder and amazement that you'll come to expect from the work he makes. 
					</p>

					<p>
						To complete such works, Luke has become proficient not only as a theory-trained, studio-savvy musician, but also in computer science and creative programming, showing understanding in creative libraries such as openFrameworks and JUCE, technical softwares such as Unity, Sibelius and Cubase and further afield interests such as Game Design, Composition and Sound Design. 
					</p>

					<p>					
						Away from computers, Luke tends to feel a little lost, but nonetheless finds enjoyment in whiskey, Pembroke Welsh Corgis, and the band Biffy Clyro. You'll often find him enjoying all three at the weekend from the comfort of his desk chair.
