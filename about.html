        You've entered the realm of Luke Child, a fiercely proud West Midlander currently lost in the graffitied jungle known as Bristol.
        Known for his love of the weird and wonderful in creative practice, Luke is a researcher, musician, and enjoyer/destroyer of things.
       
        Care to take a look around? This is not, I dare say, the Bristol botanical gardens. 
        Have you any idea where you are? Where you truly are? Welcome to the deceptively verdant mind of the Luke Thomas Child. 
        That's right! You're in the head of a fantastical, absurdly creative technologist!<br><br>

      And so into history we delve! Luke was born in Worcester, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/views_from_an_average_town">Britains most average place.</a>
      He started out actually wanting to be an animator, but given the lack of anything hand drawn on this website, you can see how well that went. Instead,
      inspired by a Welsh fridge magnet given to him by his Nan, Luke took up acoustic guitar aged 12, electric guitar aged 13, and singing aged 14. During
      this time, he was in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NewGeneration212">super cool high school cover band</a>, a super dark and heavy metal band and 
      a competing high school acapella group. But, contrasting everything else, he had a bunch of nerdy programmer/DnD friends, and they were sure as hell getting him 
      into programming...

      <br><br>

      <br>  

      <a class="next aboutButtons"  onclick="plusSlides(1)">>Okay, so music and programming?</a>

      Indeed! Luke got massively into games when he was about 14, and spent lots of time playing various games, including TES IV and V, Minecraft, Civilisation V, 
      Left for Dead 2, but perhaps most crucially... Bioshock. After completing the game and being in awe at the 'Would you kindly?' twist, Luke had a revelation and thought
      "You know what, I wanna do games for a living!".
      <br>"...but I don't code or draw, I do sound and music", he thought to himself. And it was here Luke realised, he was gonna have to be someone who makes sounds and 
      music for games. Armed with this new drive and an SM58, he got better at coding, learned some jazzy chords and modes on guitar and
      <a href="https://itslukesaudio.bandcamp.com/album/gentle-hands-2014-demo">wrote his first bunch of songs.</a>

      Okay okay...<br>
      Luke evolved out of his angsty emo phase and wish for snakebite piercings (sorry Mum) and went to university at UWE in Bristol.
      He did degree in Creative Music Technology and made lots of cool stuff, including <a href="https://itslukesaudio.bandcamp.com/album/university">
      covers of Stevie Wonder and TLC, some slightly wacky attempts at jazz and score-oriented composition</a>. It was around this time he met some
      fantastic people who helped him realise that learning and doing stuff is cool. Luke got super into reverberation and spatial audio at this point,
      writing a dissertation on Adaptive Reverberation in Video Games and building an adaptive reverberation system (or *ahem* ARS for short. I was very mature).

      Well... this reverb thing really stuck for Luke. He liked it so much that he took a masters at UWE too and continued writing and learning about reverb!
      This time, it was in the context of creative technology and design, which gave Luke the chance to learn lots of code and software, make cool things like a 
      HTTP request, music API auto-fighter called Last Band Standing, a bunch of generative art in openFrameworks, and more music! It was around this time that Luke got super
      musical, and developed the alter ego 'Cosmic', a psychedelic space-obsessed experimental rap and ambience persona 
      that <a href="https://satorirecordsuk.bandcamp.com/album/gravitate-ep">released their first album in February 2020!</a> Luke had got the creative and academic itch, and
      was ready to start actually doing something about it. 
      <br><br>


      <a class="next aboutButtons"  onclick="plusSlides(1)">>Neat! So music, code, reverb... have we finished?</a>

      I mean... are we ever finished? 
      Luke progressed from using and building reverbs to actually trying to understand how we understand 3D space, both acoustically and digitally. He discovered elicitation, 
      perceptual audio evauluation, and a bunch of fantastic researchers during masters. He enjoyed it that much that he wrote his thesis on how understanding the perception
      of reverberation from memory might help design accessible interactions with spatial audio in interactive media for those with visual and aural disabilities.
      <a href="https://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=21060">This thesis, albeit a much shorter version, actually got accepted for publication and presentation at the Audio Engineering Society's 150th Convention!</a>
      <br><br>

      As you wish! This publication really spurred Luke on to want to research in spatial audio, audio perception and accessible interaction design. He's currently
      applying for PhD funding, teaching audio programming and research modules at UWE, making weird and wacky trip hop beats, conducting research in accessible audio, 
      playing board games, hitting the gym, sampling hot sauces, making generative art, enjoying super colourful things, listening to the band Biffy Clyro, preaching that
      corgis are the superior dog breed, fighting to change the narrative and create an inclusive future for all, playing Overwatch, exclusively wearing long sleeve tees   
      and desiging text-based 'about page' adventures for those willing to read. Thank you for reading!
