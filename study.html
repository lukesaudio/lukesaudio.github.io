                    Hello there! My name is Luke. I’m a white male with glasses, a bushy beard and usually dressed in something a bit weird and wonderful. I use he/him pronouns. 
    
                    I am a second year PhD at UWE Bristol that is delving into game accessibility from a sound perspective in virtual game environments. 
                    I am super interested in the barriers that exist currently in video games and how might we begin to explore making them accessible using 'sonic interaction', a term
                    meaning the way that human beings engage with, perceive, and use sound to do things like play video games.<br><br>
                    
                    In terms of game accessibility I can rely on my own experience for some experience with gameplay barriers. I am red/green colour-deficient and neurodivergent, 
                    both of which have affected the way I approach and enjoy games. <br><br>
                    
                    However, we're a diverse bunch, us human beings. We have a diverse range of abilities that make different types of gameplay accessible or inaccessible to us.
                    As such, I’d love to talk to you about your experiences of accessibility in gaming, and furthermore how sonic interaction might aid or inhibit making games more accessible. 
                </p>

          <h1>Who is involved?</h1>

            <p>
                I will be conducting the discussions myself, however I have a supervisory team as a part of my PhD. 
                My Director of Studies is <a href="https://people.uwe.ac.uk/Person/NatanyaFord">Dr Natanya Ford</a> and my Secondary Supervisor
                is <a href="https://people.uwe.ac.uk/Person/TomMitchell">Professor Tom Mitchell</a>
            </p>
          
          <h1>What would I need to do?</h1>
            <p>
                You will be asked to take part in a discussion with me for around 30 minutes in a format of your choice. 
                This could be in person (if it is possible for me to get to you), via a video or audio call, or another format that works for you.

                You will be given a list of questions before our discussion that will help guide our chat. 
                We also have time and space to tangent a little should the conversation chose to do so!
                
                Then, after our discussion, I will transcribe and analyse our conversation. 
                You will then be invited to review the conclusions I’ve made from our discussion to make sure 
                I am representing your experiences truthfully and in a way you are comfortable with. 
            </p>

          <h1>What will the data be used for?</h1>
          <p>
            The data will be used towards writing my PhD thesis and also towards academic publications and presentations. 
            If you would be interested in authorship or being involved in this process, we can discuss this, too!
          </p>
          <h1>Are there any pre-requirements?</h1>
          <p>
              Yes, but not many! You will need to:
              <ul>
                  <li>Be over the age of 18</li>
                  <li>Be able to provide informed consent for yourself to take part in this study</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
