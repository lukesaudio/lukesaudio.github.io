        <h1>Luke Child - PhD Study Information Homepage</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        Hello, and thank you for your interest in this study. My name is Luke, I am a neurodivergent PhD student at the University of the West of England.

        My PhD explores inclusively designing tools to facilitate accessible auditory navigation design in open world video game environments.
        Last year, we conducted dialogic discussions with gamers who use accessibility features in their gameplay experiences. We discussed the areas in which
        barriers were most prevalent, the existing tools and functionality they use to navigate gameplay barriers, and how we might intervene with sonic interaction and sound design
        to allievate the pressures of these gameplay barriers. 

        <h2>My previous study</h2>
        From analysing our discussions, we generated 4 themes:
        <ol>
            <li>Navigation is a crucial accessibility barrier that spatial audio may provide access to however it is often unsuccessful due to spatial audio being isolated from other game systems or being treated as aesthetic</li>
            <li>Deep customisation of game audio features is desirable for gamers to develop setups that uniquely work for them, but abstractions/presets are required to minimise cognitive overloading or to provide entry-level engagement with accessibility features</li>
            <li>Fostering strong sonic identities allows gamers to learn and recollect game mechanics and systems quickly through auditory learning.</li>
            <li>Game information and systems should exist multimodally to allow for gamers to blend or exclude modalities based on their requirements</li>
        </ol>

        From this, we decided to focus on customisable auditory navigation systems. Gamers across a diverse range of abilities spoke about barriers in navigation
        with a specific bias towards hearing-motivated players experiencing visual barriers. 

        <h2>What are we doing for this study?</h2>

        For this study, I have been building a navigation tool for open world game environments with a focus on accessibility for Blind and Low Vision gamers,
        extended to gamers who are hearing motivated in their gameplay experiences. 
        <br><br>
        Based on the dialogic conversations and my own research, I have built a first prototype. To develop this further, I am organising a series of compensated co-design workshops
        in which 2 Blind and Low Vision gamers are invited per sesssion to test the tool out and dialogically discuss it's development with the eachother and researcher. 

        Additionally, I will engage in discussions with game and software developers to address the feasability of such a tool in a design and development concept. It is hoped that 
        these discussions can mitigate the design of the tool being bespoke, and instead provide feedback on how such a tool might exist between different game development paradigms. 

        <h2>What is required of me?</h2>
        The first round of co-designing will take place on the UWE Bristol Frenchay Campus. Each session will features 2 participants and myself.
        You will be given a working version of my navigation tool to play around with, as well as a series of tasks to complete. 
        While you complete the task, data will be collected about different gameplay statistics, such as the journey you take and which tool settings you use, for example. 
        Additionally, we will engage in conversation about your experiences with gaming and accessibility generally, as well as testing, developing and speculating about the navigation tool. This will be recorded for analysis. 

        <br><br>

        We will anonymise all interactions by default. If you would like to waive anonymity (either with your name or through a username) then we can provide you with noted accreditations for your input to the tool. 
        If you would still like to be anonymously credited, we can discuss this, too!

        <br><br>

        Participants will be compensated £25 via:
        <ul>
            <li>A gift card at a vendor of their choice</li>
            <li>A donation to a charity of their choice (made by the researcher)</li>
        </ul>

        Unfortunately, there is no specific travel budget available, however at the discretion of the lead researcher, this can be discussed.
