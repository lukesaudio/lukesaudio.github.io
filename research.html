                    My research focuses on auditory navigation in open world video games for Blind and Low Vision acccessibility. 
                    I'm investigating ways to sonify navigation and environment information in virtual environments and how we
                    commuicate this information to gamers to design accessible gameplay systems around it. 
                    
                    <br><br>

                    One of the biggest barriers for Blind and Low Vision gamers is being able to
                    independently navigate virtual world spaces, not just functionally, but enjoyably, too. As such, I'm building systems that not only try to prioritise successful navigation,
                    but also facilitate the curiousity and excitement found in many open world adventures found in virtual game environments.

                        I also teach alongside my research! My teaching tends to be in the areas of HCI, game audio design and programming, audio programming, HCI and research methods/project supervision.
                        I strive to create inclsuive spaces for progressive and awesome discussions and practice. I employ dialogic teaching practice and collaboration to make sure students get the
                        best chance to apply and develop their skills as people. And obviously, I drop in good discussion around inclusive design and accessibility throughout all I do.
