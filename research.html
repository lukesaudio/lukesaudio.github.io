      <h1>Luke does research?</h1>
      <p class="mainContentRightText">
        Oh I have, indeed. Here is a list of my research and outputs. My research is based in spatial audio, game audio, interaction design
        and accessibility. I am a PhD student, and my research explores the affordances of audio interaction in designing accessible navigation and narratives in virtual environments. 
        I am developing methods on collaborating with visually and hearing impaired participants in sound-related research, considering
        how sound can be interacted with in virtual environment spaces, the information that is afforded by sound in these enviroments, and
        how this information might manifest in other formats.<br><br>Entries hosted on other sites externally link to their respective hosts. Please scroll down to find them.

          <h3>Overview</h3>
          
            My PhD explores accessible sonic interaction design with spatialised sound in virtual environments from the perspective of B/blind and D/deaf users. 
            Sound is commonplace in virtual environments found in linear and non-linear media and is often designed aesthetically for the enjoyment of those engaging with them. 
            My PhD considers sound design from a functional and mechanical perspective, seeking to understand the role of spatialised sound and how it can be designed to afford narrative and navigational information to a user interacting with it.
            Through an inclusive and collaborative emancipatory methodology, rooted in understanding and engaging with lived experience to inform design research, this project will outline successful practices in working with B/blind and D/deaf participants in sonic interaction research, understand the sonic affordances intrinsic to the virtual environment, 
            and provide prototypes for novel sonic interaction systems for use within new virtual environment design.

          <h3>Research Questions</h3>
        
            <li>1.	What is successful and unsuccessful practice when conducting sonic interaction research with B/blind and D/deaf participants?</li>
            <li>2.	What information is afforded to B/blind participants when engaging with sonic interactions in virtual environments?</li>
            <li>3.	What sonic information is not accessible to D/deaf participants and how might this translate into other formats?</li>
            <li>4.	How can information afforded by engagement with sonic interactions in virtual environments be used to develop novel implementations of accessible sonic interactions?</li>
