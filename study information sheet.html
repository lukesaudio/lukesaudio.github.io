        <h1>
          Reflexive thematic analysis of  sonic interaction and accessibility in
          virtual game environments - Study Information
        </h1>
      
      <h2>
          Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
          Video  games often feature virtual environment spaces for a player to be
          present in.  These environments may feature gameplay mechanics, spaces to
          navigate, or  narratives to be explored to create an enveloping, immersive
          experience.  However, many of these implementations may be designed in ways
          that are only  accessible via a single method or style of interaction, such
          as a visual map, character  conversations, or pressing buttons quickly
          through reaction-based Quick Time  Events (QTE)
      </p>
      <p>
          Certain  games have experimented outside of conventional gameplay mechanics
          to develop  accessible methods of multimodal interaction with gameplay
          features. For example,  in 2023, Sea of Thieves (Rare, 2018) featured an
          audio-based weapon Aim Assist to  accompany sight-based aiming, outlined by
          Can I Play That writer ‘ActiveB1t’  (2023):
      </p>
      <p>
          “When the  target is off to the left or right, players can follow the sound
          in that  direction. To determine if they should be aiming lower or higher,
          the pitch of  the sound changes as well. When the player’s aim is on the
          target, another  distinctive click sound plays letting the player know.”
      </p>
      <p>
          Similarly,  through ‘<em>Can I Play That</em>’, Steve Saylor’s accessibility
          breakdown (2020)  of Ghost of Tsushima (Sucker Punch Studios, 2020)
          discusses the use of wind  sounds as a navigational tool alongside a visual
          counterpart.
      </p>
      <p>
          Steve  elaborates:
      </p>
      <p>
          “So,  first off, I wanna [sic] talk about the waypoint system or the way to
          navigate  based on a gust of wind. From myself, personally, in my game play,
          this is  great. I love when they can be able to create a new system that
          still allows  the waypoint system but still keeps the emersion [sic] of it.
          And I love that  the balance of this, where you can be able to still see the
          gust of wind, no  matter where you are, you can see it in any direction. You
          can be able to turn  it on at any given point to make sure that you’re going
          the right way and I  actually really do like this.”
      </p>
      <p>
          This  study will engage in discussions with gamers to identify current
          barriers in  video games and how interaction with sound may begin to provide
          improved access  to specific gameplay features.

      <h2>
          Study Ethics
      </h2>
      <p>
          This study reflects the NIME  Principles &amp; Code of Practice on Ethical
          Research (Morreale, 2023) where  possible and seeks to “employ decolonising
          research methods that value a  dialogic relationship between researchers and
          communities researched”.
      </p>
      <h2>
          Study Aims
      </h2>
      <p>
          ·         Identify  current accessibility barriers within video games
      </p>
      <p>
          ·         Document uses  of sonic interaction in existing video games
      </p>
      <p>
          ·         Highlight  areas of inaccessibility within games that could be
          improved with sonic  interaction
      </p>
      <h2>
          Study Objectives
      </h2>
      <p>
          ·         Engage  in dialogic discussion with gamers about sonic interaction
          and accessibility in  different game scenarios and develop a data corpus of
          this data
      </p>
      <p>
          ·         Conduct  a reflexive thematic analysis to generate themes
          surrounding accessible sonic  interaction in games
      </p>

      <h2>
          Methodology
      </h2>
      <h3>
          Participant Sampling
      </h3>
      <p>
          Purposive  sampling will be used within the researcher’s extended network to
          select initial  participants, with snowball sampling employed where
          possible. Participants will  be initially contacted using the participant’s
          primary form of interaction - this  is usually email or social media.
      </p>
      <h3>
          Participant Sample Size
      </h3>
      <p>
          A  participant sample size of 30 participants is desired, with flexibility
          to  expand on this amount if the project allows. Due to the diversity of
          disabilities that may be present in discussions, it is pertinent to capture
          many perspectives to provide a cohesive representation of disability within
          video  game access. Equally, participants may experience barriers to game
          access but  may not identify as disabled. Including the experiences across a
          spectrum of  disability facilitates inclusivity by challenging the
          disabled/non-disabled  binary, which in turn may result in higher
          participant numbers to accommodate  more perspectives.
      </p>
      <h3>
          Discussion  Preparation
      </h3>
      <p>
          If a  participant accepts the invitation to partake in the study, an initial
          requirements chat will take place to establish an accessible and inclusive
          practice for the discussion. This will then be implemented prior to the
          discussion. Depending on access to a physical location, discussions will
          take  place either in person or online via a call.
      </p>
      <h3>
          Semi-Structured Discussion
      </h3>
      <p>
          Semi-structured  discussions will be conducted with the selected
          participants. Discussions will endeavour  to “employ decolonising research
          methods that value a dialogic relationship  between researchers and
          communities researched”. (Morreale, 2023)
      </p>
      <h3>
          Reflexive Thematic Analysis (RTA) of Individual Discussions
      </h3>
      <p>
          A reflexive  thematic analysis (Braun and Clark, 2021) of each participant’s
          discussion will  be conducted by the researcher to generate relevant themes
          from the discussion.
      </p>
      <h3>
          Consultation of RTA with Participants
      </h3>
      <p>
          The  researcher will validate the results with each participant once the
          initial RTA  is completed. This stage will allow for validation and further
          discussion  around the researcher’s subjective interpretation of the
          discussion.
      </p>
      <h3>
          RTA of Data Corpus
      </h3>
      <p>
          A  reflexive thematic analysis of the data corpus will be conducted to
          generate meta  themes between participant discussions. This will allow for
          distinctions to  made between shared and individual experiences.
