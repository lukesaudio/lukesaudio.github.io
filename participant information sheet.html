        <p>
            You are invited to take part in a study undertaken at the  University of the
            West of England, Bristol. Before you decide whether to take  part, it is
            important for you to understand why the study is being done and  what it
            will involve. Please read the following information carefully and if  you
            have any queries or would like more information, please contact Luke Child
            at UWE Bristol via luke.child@uwe.ac.uk

            The PhD researcher is

            What  is the aim of the research?
        </h2>
        <p>
            This research study seeks to engage with gamers to  understand the use of
            interaction with sound as an accessibility tool in video  game environments.
            The primary research questions are:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                How is sound utilised as an accessibility tool in video  game
                environments?
            </li>
            <li>
                What are the applications of sonic interaction in video  games?
            </li>
            <li>
                What additional access barriers are present in video  games?
            </li>
            <li>
                How might sonic interaction begin to provide  accessibility for these
                barriers?
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>
            Why  have I been invited to take part?
        </h2>
        <p>
            We are interested in gaining information about your experience  of playing
            video games and utilising sound as an access tool.  Our discussion will ask
            you about these  things. The purpose of the questions will be to understand
            sonic interaction  and accessibility from a lived experience perspective.
            This will provide a  foundation for developing novel implementations of
            sonic interaction design in  video game environments.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Do  I have to take part?
        </h2>
        <p>
            You do not have to take part in this research. It is up to  you to decide
            whether or not you want to be involved. If you do decide to take  part, you
            will be given a copy of this information sheet to keep and will be  asked to
            sign a consent form. If you do decide to take part, you are able to
            withdraw from the research without giving a reason. However, a point of no
            return is reached once the final discussion around validating our
            conclusions  is undertaken. This date will be discussed with you during the
            initial  discussion.  If you want to withdraw from  the study within this
            period, please write to
            <a href="mailto:luke.child@uwe.ac.uk">
                luke.child@uwe.ac.uk
            </a>
            . Deciding not to  take part or to withdrawal from the study does not have
            any penalty and will  not affect progress or assessment of the PhD student’s
            work.
        </p>
        <h2>
            What  will happen to me if I take part and what do I have to do?
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you agree to take part, you will be asked to take part in  a discussion
            in a format of your choosing. This will be conducted by the  student
            researcher. It is anticipated that the discussion will take  approximately
            30 minutes to 1 hour.
        </p>
        <p>
            The subject and focus of the discussion will be your  experiences playing
            video games, the access barriers you have encountered, and  the way sound
            and sonic interaction have improved your access to video games.  Your
            answers will be fully anonymised.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the discussion, you will be provided with a unique  identifier that
            will be used to re-identify you if you choose to withdraw from  the study
            within the period. At the point of text transcription, your  voice/video
            recording will be deleted. Your data will be anonymised at this  point and
            will be analysed with discussion data from other anonymised  participants.
        </p>
        <h2>
            What  information am I required to provide?
        </h2>
        <p>
            You will be invited to discuss the questions provided in the  ‘Questionnaire
            Sheet’ provided alongside this document. You will be asked to  reflect on
            your experiences with sound interaction in games, the way sound has provided
            access to parts of a game and access barriers you encounter within games. We
            will also discuss around how sound could begin to alleviate the identified
            barriers.
        </p>
        <h2>
            What  are the benefits of taking part?
        </h2>
        <p>
            You will be providing the foundation for future research  studies in
            accessible sonic interaction design for video game environments.
        </p>
        <br clear="all"/>
        <h2>
            What  are the possible risks of taking part?
        </h2>
        <p>
            We do not foresee or anticipate any significant risk to you  in taking part
            in this study. If, however, you feel uncomfortable at any time  you can ask
            for the discussion to stop. If you need any support during or after  the
            discussion, then the researcher will be able to put you in touch with
            suitable support agencies. The researcher’s Director of Studies and
            supervision  team is experienced in conducting and supervising discussions
            and will support  the student to conduct the research sensitively. The
            discussion has been  designed with these considerations in mind.
        </p>
        <h2>
            What  will happen to your information?
        </h2>
        <p>
            All the information that you give will be kept confidential  and anonymised
            at the point of transcription. The only circumstance where we  may not be
            able to keep you information confidential is in the event of  safeguarding
            or legality concerns. Hard copy research material will be kept  secure in
            the researcher’s office and digital data will be stored on the  University’s
            secure OneDrive system to which  only the researcher and their supervision
            team will have access in accordance  with the Data Protection Act 2018 and
            General Data Protection Regulation  requirements. Voice and video recordings
            will be destroyed securely immediately  after anonymised transcription. Your
            anonymised data will be analysed together  with other discussion and file
            data, and we will ensure that there is no  possibility of identification or
            re-identification from this point.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Where  will the results of the research be submitted or published?
        </h2>
        <p>
            A PhD thesis will be written containing the research  findings and submitted
            to the University. A copy may be displayed in the  University library. If
            you are interested in reading a copy please contact Luke  Child via
            <a href="mailto:luke.child@uwe.ac.uk">

        </p>
        <p>
            The anonymised results may also be used in conference papers  and
            peer-reviewed academic papers. Anonymous and non-identifying direct quotes
            may be used for publication and presentation purposes.
