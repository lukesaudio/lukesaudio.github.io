                    Walking Billboards, a DIY indie band rough around the edges and with a dash of silliness to match. 
                    For fans of jangly pop guitars, rough and tumble vocals and plenty of catchy sing along moments.

                        Their first EP is a delve into lo-bit music at super low bit depths and sample rates. Their eponymous EP is available on floppy disk, consisting of 7 tracks under 1MB in their entirety!
