I can be your president
If you want me to be your president
I wouldn’t be a very good president
But I’m better than your president, woo!
Step One, I’m gonna build a wall
And stick it around your house
Just to help it look a little nicer
Step two, now let’s go talk to NASA
Hey aliens, Mi Casa Su Casa
Let’s get to Mars a little faster
I can be your president
If you want me to be your president
I wouldn’t be a good president
But I’m better than your president, woo!
Maybe if I get a second term
We can the shitty people learn
That being nice to everyone is cool
And even though it seems like a shout
I really think we could do without
Interplanetary space defences  
Now I just wanna be offensive
But I think it’s quite a farce
That the president before you can’t wipe his own arse
And I guess I’m the guy who can
I can be your president
If you want me to be your president
I wouldn’t be a very good president
So, let’s pray for another president, woo
I can be your president
If you want me to be your president
I wouldn’t be a very good president
But I’m better than your fucking president, woo!
She lives for automatic
But knows how to ride stick
Her body’s like a Prius, she’s electric
She is a four door
Can I afford her?
Only got four tires, does that make her narcoleptic?
My Ex’s mum was a drag car racer
There wasn’t a soul who could out race her
If you were a pencil she’s an eraser
My Ex’s mum was a drag car racer
I don’t know much about her life cause she always said no spoilers
And spending time with her was always a drag
That’s why they locked me up in here
While she’s chasing a flag
My Ex’s mum was a drag car racer
There wasn’t a soul who could out race her
If you were a pencil she’s an eraser
My Ex’s mum was a drag car racer
My Ex’s mum was a drag car racer	
There wasn’t a soul who could out race her
If you were a pencil she’s an eraser
My Ex’s mum was a drag car racer
My Ex’s mum was a drag car racer
There wasn’t a soul who could out race her
If you were a pencil she’s an eraser
My Ex’s mum was a drag car racer
Sunday, 4pm
Sandwiches for working men
Cleaning tables and dusting chairs
While I wait for you at Charlies
Checkered apron make up free
Hoping that you'll notice me
Outside the door with a chocolate brownie
Waiting outside Charlies
Oh I fell in love with a coffee girl
She scrubs up good and sends your life into a swirl
Oh I fell in love with a beautiful barista
And I’ll always be grateful
For my girl the barista of the week
You used to say Oh I smelled like chips
Yet you still came home with lots of tips
And we spent them all on weekend trips
When you stopped working at Charlies
When the time came and you said goodbye
I held you close when you cried
Fran said there's always more chips to fry
Waiting for you at Charlies
Oh I fell in love with a coffee girl
She scrubs up good and sends your life into a swirl
Oh I fell in love with a beautiful barista
And I’ll always be grateful
For my girl the barista of the week
She came to me in a dream
She was 86 and a dancer but never a has been
She said to me my son I hung my shoes up long ago
But I'll teach them how to do it till I'm way beyond my time
But I don't know
What's going on
I'm scared of getting old cause I have nothing to believe but my
self and now I know 
I need something to rely on
It's faith in you I can rely on
Did I delete your name from the phonebook? Or call your line another thousand times?
I’m not quite content with you not being alive anymore
And who the heck am I gonna ring?
When I just wanna talk about anything but the kitchen sink
Don’t worry
I won’t worry
I won’t move on, but I’ll be keeping fine
Now should I get on my knees and get desperate?
Or let this ship take a thousand hits
I’ll sink to the bottom, and I’ll call it quits for the last time
Don’t worry
I won’t worry
I’ve moved on, I hope you’re keeping fine
