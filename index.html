        <h1>About</h1>  
       
        <img src="/images/Banner.png" alt="A close up of Luke's face looking to the side. He has a gentle smile, bushy beard and thick frame glasses.">
        <p>
            Luke Child (he/him) is a PhD Student, Lecturer and Creative Technologist. Luke is a White male with a bushy beard,
            quiffed short hair and glasses. He usually dons something colourful and abstract, with fashionable items ranging from
            neon cat <a href="https://lucyandyak.com">Lucy and Yaks </a> to <a href="https://pizzamas.com/">a collection of t-shirts with author John Green's mustaschio-ed face on it.</a><br><br>
      
            Originally from Worcester, home of the famous mispronounced sauce, he now operates out of Bristol, UK. Luke is working towards a PhD in Accessible Sonic Interaction Design in Virtual Environments and collaborates with undergraduate students working on 
            research methods, audio programming, and accessible design.<br><br>
      
            A big fan of weird and wonderful things, Luke likes music that ventures into experimental territories (particularly rhythmic), patching together 
            unconventional signal chains, and making and breaking things in the quest for surprising outcomes. He is almost always listening to
            <a href="https://www.biffyclyro.com">Biffy Clyro</a>, or at least music with some weird time-based tomfoolery. He also very much loves Corgis and befriends them at a moments notice. You can also add enjoying Japanese food and whiskey, kicking ass at Scrabble, and having a tense relationship with seagulls, to this list.

        <h1>Research and Education</h1>  

            <h2>PhD</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently studying towards a PhD at the <a href="https://www.uwe.ac.uk">University of the West of England</a>. My PhD is currently titled 'Accessible Sonic Interaction Design for Virtual Environments'
                and is supervised by <a href="https://people.uwe.ac.uk/Person/NatanyaFord">Dr Natanya Ford</a> and <a href="https://people.uwe.ac.uk/Person/TomMitchell">Dr Thomas Mitchell</a>. We are investigating
                inaccessibility in contemporary video game mechanics, narratives and navigation and researching novel methods of improving access through sonic interaction design.
            </p>
            <h2>Lecturing</h2>
            <p>My teaching is split between three primary areas: first year audio programming, second year research methods, and third year dissertation supervision. I strive to create collaborative and dialogic partnerships with my students, endeavouring to learn just as much alongside them. We also love bringing along a sprinkle of seredipitous creativity, wonder and weirdness in these parts!

                I encourage students to consider accessibility and inclusive design in their projects, regardless of topic. It is my hope that new graduates are aware that designing for all is an awesome thing to do and bring this ethos forward with them in their work!</p>

            <h2>Masters</h2>
            <p>
                My Masters was in Creative Technologies at the <a href="https://www.uwe.ac.uk">University of the West of England</a>. My thesis was under the supervision of <a href="https://buzzo.com/">Professor Dan Buzzo</a> and 
                <a href="https://people.uwe.ac.uk/Person/NatanyaFord">Dr Natanya Ford</a> and was titled 'Utilising elicitation methods to understand and design informative and accessible experiences of digital reverberation'.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Publications</h2>
            <p>My publications are available in the following table from most recent to oldest. Links to external sites may feature content behind paid memberships. Preprints are available!:</p>

                <p>Cosmic is my intergalactic, space-faring alter ego that produces music at the intersection of trip hop, hyperpop, jazz fusion and math rock. 
                    Exploring spacey themes through rap, polyrhythm and experimentation, Cosmic brings the biscuits and invites you for the best cuppa this side of the galaxy.

                    Tongue-in-cheek PhD punk from either end of the M4 corridor. Along with fellow researcher <a href="http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/people/profiles/fordcoreyjohn.html"></a>
                you can find punk to dance to with your nan and granddad. Their first EP 'Drag Car Racer' takes you through wild stories involving the drag-racing mothers of ex girlfriends, dancing old ladies, being a better president than what is on offer, and remembing loved ones who've passed.

                    <p>
                        When a pub 5 minutes away from your old house provides the perfect facilitation for drunken friends and acoustic guitars, you make a band from it. Alongisde fellow creative techie <a href="https://archiehollyfield.co.uk/">Archie Hollyfield</a>
                        you can find silly songs made up over beer from <a href="https://www.basementbeer.co.uk/">Basement Beer in Bristol</a> and more recently, DIY indie hits using word generators for song titles.

                        Dusty, chilled, and glitchy lo-fi production from Space Dad matched with lyrical whimiscalness and jazzy sprinkles from Cosmic, their first EP is coming soon...
                    </p>
            <h2>Our Spaceship Up Against Yours</h2>
                    <p>
                        Generative coding and chance meets alternative math rock and a tinge of midwest emo. Playing into Luke's teenage years, this project takes the gritty guitar tones 
                        and shouty vocals of bands like Biffy Clyro, Funeral for a Friend and Alexisonfire and stirs it up in a pot with dice-rolled time signatures, random drunken midi in <a href="https://cycling74.com/products/max">Max MSP</a>
                        and enough randomness to rival a 2010s teen with lens-less glasses with a moustasche on their finger. More information coming soon...
