        <div class="text">A photograph taken of me playing drums in the live room of Axe and Trap studios in Wells, UK. The studio has a really warm and homely feel to it; there are old instruments around, the colour scheme is fairly natural and uses lots of wood/old rugs/baffling to decorate and treat the room. I'm playing a 4 piece drum set with 2 crashes, a ride and a set of high hats. There are two microphones placed above the drums in the photo, and other mics placed over the kit.   </div>

I am a white male, with a beard, short hair and glasses and I am stood against a graffiti covered wall down a side street in Bristol. I look a little moody, but that's just me trying to pose seriously for a photograph. I am wearing a black t shirt with the Satori Records logo on it. The logo is the kanji characters for Satori, which translates to enlightenment in English. </div>

I have my eyes closed, but this was accidental, as right at the last second, I started into a reflection of the sun, but Ben caught the photo before I looked like I was squinting, and instead, I look like I'm asleep with a smile.</div>
