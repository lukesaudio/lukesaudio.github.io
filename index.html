                        <h1>I am Luke, known online as Cites and Sounds</h1>
                        <p>Forged in the fires of noise and rainbows in the West Midlands, I travelled to Bristol to study music technology and then stayed
                            to research accessible audio design for video games. I describe myself as a creative technologist with a penchant for game audio and accessibility.
                            
                            Here are some things I love: 
                            the band Biffy Clyro, 
                            Japanese whisky, 
                            Corgis, 
                            character creation menus,
                            crunchy leaves and
                            chocolate milk.                             
                        
                        </p>

                            I'm actually a PhD student doing this, but I often procrastinate by building new websites.
